h2. Ariel - A Ruby Information Extraction Library

Ariel is a library that allows you to extract information from semi-structured
documents (such as websites). It is different to existing tools because rather
than expecting the developer to write rules to extract the desired information,
Ariel will use a small number of labeled examples to generate and learn
effective extraction rules. It is developed by Alex Bradbury and released under
the MIT license. Ariel was started as a Google Summer of Code project mentored
by Austin Ziegler in 2006.

h2. Installation

@gem install ariel@

h2. Quick start/Basic usage

* @require 'ariel'@
* Define a structure for the information you wish to extract: <pre>
structure = Ariel::Node::Structure.new do |r|
  r.item :title
  r.item :body
  r.list :comments do |c|
    c.list_item :comment do |d|
      d.item :author
      d.item :body
    end
  end
end
</pre>
* Collect a few examples of the sort of document you wish to extract information
  from (pages from the same website for instance).
* Label each example with tags such as @<l:title>@, @<l:comment>@ and so on in the
  relevant places.
* @Ariel.learn structure, labeled_file1, labeled_file2, labeled_file3@
* Find the documents you want to extract information from.
* @extractions = Ariel.extract structure, unlabeled_file1, unlabeled_file2@
* <code>extractions[0].search('comments/*/body').each {|e| puts e.extracted_text} =>
  "Great stuff, loving it", "I love life", .....</code>
* @extractions[0].at('comments/34') => nil@ (there is no 34th comment, #at
  returns the first result rather than an array of matches).
