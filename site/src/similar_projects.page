_Note_: Although this page is titled similar projects, this naming is perhaps
inaccurate. I aim to collect references to projects (primarily Ruby) that assist
in the extraction of information, mostly web pages. However, Ariel is in no way
limited to HTML extraction.

h2. Ruby based tools for HTML extraction

* "Hpricot":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ - written by why the lucky
  stiff. Uses a speedy html parser written in C.
* "WWW::Mechanize":http://mechanize.rubyforge.org/ - based off the original Perl
  module. Helps automate interaction with a website. You might find this very
  useful to use to retrieve pages for use with Ariel. Latest development version
  uses Hpricot under the hood.
* "RubyfulSoup":http://www.crummy.com/software/RubyfulSoup/ - port of the Python
  BeautifulSoup library.
* "ScrAPI":http://rubyforge.org/projects/scrapi/ - "described at the author's
  blog":http://blog.labnotes.org/2006/07/11/scraping-with-style-scrapi-toolkit-for-ruby/.
* "Feedalizer":http://termos.vemod.net/feedalizer

h2. Other tools

* "PonyFish":http://www.ponyfish.com - an online service that has a nice
  interface, but is very limited in that it can only learn to extract URLs. If
  this is all you need however, it seems to work well.
* "Dapper":http://www.dappit.com - this is another online service that's had a
  lot of coverage recently. Does a great job of demonstrating the power of tools
  that can learn extraction rules by example. I see no reason why a similar
  service couldn't be created using Ariel.
* "Webstemmer":http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/webstemmer/index.html - a
  Python project that aims to automatically extract the main text from news
  sites. The "detailed description of how it
  works":http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/webstemmer/howitworks.html is
  excellent, I highly recommend you take a look.
* "Crawl-by-example":http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/SOC06/Crawl-by-example
  - I must take a look at the work done by another student for Summer of Code
  2006 for the Internet Archive. The ideas behind this could be useful to make
  a companion to Ariel to automatically harvest documents to extract
  information from.
